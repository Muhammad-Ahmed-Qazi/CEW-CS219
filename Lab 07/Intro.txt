Basic difference between GUI and Command-driven interface:
- Efficiency of command-driven interface: it is faster than GUI

Flags prefixed with '-' and arguments customise their behaviour for precise control over your system.

Command in Linux is a program which is executed... (Duh 🥱)

touch - Create files (also 'cat'; can enter content) (Only create a file, but can't enter contents into the file directly)
cp - Copy files
mv - Move or rename
rm - Remove files

cat - Display content
grep - Search text
less - Page through files

uname - System information
top - Real time monitoring
ps - List processes

whoami - Current user
chmod - Change permissions
chown - Change ownership

ssh - Remote access
ping - Test connection
ip/ifconfig - Network config
